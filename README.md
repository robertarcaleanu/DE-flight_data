## Data Engineering project

This projects consists of simple Extract Transform Load pipeline. The steps followed during the development are listed below:

1. Download the data from the AMS Airport API - [here](https://developer.schiphol.nl/) 
2. Clean the data
3. Validate the data
4. Store the data
5. Create Dashboard

### Extract the data

The data is extracted from the Schipol Developer Center [website] (https://developer.schiphol.nl/) and the endpoint is `flights` .

### Clean the data

### Validate the data


### Store the data

Initially, the data will be stored in a PostgreSQL or SQL Lite database.

### Create a dashboard

The dashboard will be created using Power BI. It includes the following:

- Feature 1
- Feature 2


_Possible next steps could be:_

* Automate pipeline (e.g. using Airflow)
* Make the pipeline idempotent
