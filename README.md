## Data Engineering project

This projects consists of simple Extract Transform Load pipeline. The steps followed during the development are listed below:

1. Download the data from the AMS Airport API - [here](https://aviationstack.com/documentation) 
2. Clean the data
3. Validate the data
4. Store the data
5. Create Dashboard

### Extract the data

### Clean the data

### Validate the data


### Store the data

### Create a dashboard



_Possible next steps could be:_

* Automate pipeline (e.g. using Airflow)
* Make the pipeline idempotent
